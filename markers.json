I would definitely recommend checking them out.",

And it's not as if they've a large, comfy reading area in which you can sample books and relish the sounds of silence.  What they have are two stuffed chairs backs to the front window and facing the cash register that you can't sit in for more than ten minutes.  Which is a good thing in a way, because if you need to use a restroom, and don't want to chance another business having a \"customers only\" restroom policy, you'll have to hike down the street, ascend the steps to the entrance of City Hall, and descend the steps to the basement.  If you're visiting this bookstore, my advice is to walk in, walk around once, make a mental note of books to check out and buy elsewhere, and walk out.",

I pre-ordered the re-release of Wayne Barlowe\u2019s \u201cExpedition\u201d, a rather rare book, for a friend for Christmas and the edition that Echo Point provided was absolutely gorgeous, with a sleek hard cover and additional content at the beginning. In transit, the binding was unfortunately damaged, and so I reached out to Echo Point through their website. I received an email back almost immediately and Nora from customer service was incredibly kind in her response. After sending some pictures of the damage, I was offered to be either refunded or expedited a replacement. I chose to be expedited a replacement and it arrived in just two days and in perfect condition. Echo Point\u2019s service was incredibly quick, responsive, and considerate, and I would absolutely recommend going to them for your book and novel needs. I know I certainly will from now on :)",

With their cozy atmosphere and a book oracle like Barbara, they go above and beyond. I knew I couldn\u2019t purchase anything because we were vacationing in Vermont, and our suitcases were already bursting at the seams, but one book called out to me. After we returned home, I sent Barbara an email describing the book (it turned out to not be a terribly accurate description) and its approximate location. Barbara found it for me, and it\u2019s now on its way to me!  I could spend weeks in that store.",

However will say that when I do ask for help, I'm always given good customer service.\n\nThe Cafe for Starbucks is good.  It is a smaller menu, but there are always fresh Bakery items. And I'm usually able to order some of my favorite drinks.\n\nOverall, I'll say that this location always has many good books and are one of the only businesses open late in the area! The staff is friendly and locating what you need is fairly easy.  I also give props to B&N for always offering ways to save money be it a membership, coupons or bogo days.  This location is a staple and has been around for as long as I'm able to remember, so my review is also steeped in nostalgia. I would definitely recommend coming here!",

Today was the first time we were greeted by a security guard at the door . Which is fine, definitely more security is needed these days! I started noticing he would show up to every section(and we visited them all) and would get close,  pick a book up and pretend to look at it. After the 4th time I started feeling uncomfortable.  I agree with watching the store, completely. But I didn\u2019t appreciate it to this degree. It started to make me angry and super uncomfortable. He did this so many times I wanted to ask what his issue was. Don\u2019t make your customers feel like this. Watching is one thing but following someone to this extent is not necessary. Especially for absolutely no reason !!",

So when I saw there was one not to far from where we were at the time I jumped at the chance of going. I had been wanting to get some books and they had the one that I was looking for.  So I purchased it and left. We got to the car thinking that was a little pricey for the book, but I really wanted it. So I went online seeing if the book was supposed to cost that much, it was Not!! It was $15 cheaper online.  So we returned it and we got the book online. I did buy 2 other sale books from the money we got back. Just curious of why that was so much more in the store? Maybe overhead is a lot?",

I tried to call back several times and she would pick up the phone and slam it down.  I ended up leaving my office to go to the store in person.  Once on-site the owner was all giggly like hanging up on a customer was funny.

Due to how long it has been there, I recieved a tube of mascara completely glued shut. Upon forcing it open, the wand had snapped off and the product was completely solid.\n\nTo make up for it, the college merchandise is of good qualitiy and there is pretty good sales that occur often. For books and pencils and really good coffee, the store is decent. Do not get your hopes too much though!",

After the mask mandate was dropped my family and I had gone in planning to look around only to be told in a very rude manner that if we didn't have masks to leave. We were both fully vaccinated. It was uncalled for. I lost respect for Phoenix books in that moment. Secondly I had learned that a few friends of ours who are local authors had been screwed over by Phoenix having their books banned and not recieved their dues for all their book sales.Their customer service lacks severely never asking once if we ever needed help they would rather chat amongst themselves. I'd rather shop at Bookmobile and online then ever go into Phoenix bookstore ever again. Lost my business forever. If you're looking for a pleasant bookstore experience don't go to Phoenix.",

Keep it up.\n\nUpdate:\nApparently since the pandemic customer service has gotten worse. That comment was 3 years ago. With cdc guidelines dropping masks mandates and schools also giving kids the option not to wear a mask in schools.  Its lost on phenix.\nThey rather turn away business if a customer doesn't wear mask. (I'm vaccinated) i didn't realize they made that kind of money to turn customers away not when they have had the rent and utilities subsidized for a few years now.\nOf course it is their business not mine so i myself will never give them any more of my money and my family has agreed not to go in there any more either. Its a shame i am a big supporter of supporting local businesses i think everyone should that is why our downtown looks so blank with everyone shopping online ive always gone to the local shops first and i will with the other ones still open in downtown but that one.",

None of the ladies looked me in the eyes nor said anything, other than the total amounts. Both visits were cold and callous. Does the female staff hate men? Clearly, I am not welcomed at Yankee Bookshop. I prefer, and recommend, Norwich Bookstore. At least the staff there is friendly.",

They also have blind bags of books that you can buy for $1 in different genres that come 3 books to a bag. It reminds me a little of the Hamilton bookshop in NYC.",

Lots of classics in collectible editions that will fit anyone's library shelf.\nThe store is well lit with tall ceilings, staff if friendly and knowledgeable, and all the prices are clearly indicated. I am told they also buy and trade books at fair values.\nWorth many visits!",

I really enjoyed the layout of the store and that it was adjoined to a cafe. The sections were clearly marked, the inside felt cozy, the staff were nice, and they even had an upstairs for kids (with a really neat metal staircase).\n\nThe bookstore itself is in a historic house, which is also really neat and it\u2019s right in the middle of downtown. I really have nothing bad to say about it.",

Every corner there was something new I just had to see. I could have stayed there for hours just exploring the many options to sit, stand, walk, talk, eat or all of the above. What a perfect opponent to slow down grab a book and some coffee or tea and just be. Everything else can wait. Do yourself a favor and remember this place.

Lots of gifts, games etc. A few chairs, a bench and bean bag chair to sit and read. Owners are community driven, and go above and beyond with customer service...and then there's their store mascot \"Boo\", he's very well mannered!",

It's so pretty!\"\n\nThanks Sandy for the happy surprise of a great wrapping paper job, and for super speedy shipping.",

Like craft books? Like design books? Like books on the outdoors? Like spirituality and religion reads? Like Vermont authors? Like fiction and the best deals on mass market paperbacks you can find? Come to the bookmobile!\n\nAnd if you can't find the book you are looking for, you can go across the street to phoenix books making the whole trip a great destination.

A great local business to support, and the prices are very reasonable. Nancy was extremely helpful when I asked her to show me around and locate items.She also made wonderful recommendations. It is clear that she takes a lot of effort to curate and provide a great selection for her customers. She also offers a great selection of materials local to the Vermont and New Hampshire region.",

I popped in looking for something specific, a paperback edition of the complete and uncut The Stand, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, Ian was able to pull that exact copy off of his shelf which turned into a 45 minute conversation about King and what is involved in him creating something \u201ccomplete and uncut\u201d, leading to a conversation about graphic novels, and the history of comics, and talking about stores from over the years that Brattleboro has lost.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you\u2019re looking for a book and some engaging conversation with someone who loves the world of books, go to Book Lovers.

There are thousands of novels, some of which are by local authors. Kim is wonderful, positive, and always has great recommendations. The children's section has a spot for kids to play or sit and read while the adults get lost in reading the synopsis of the many choices. There are chairs placed in different nooks to sit and read if you wish. The atmosphere is laid back, allowing you to enjoy taking your time while browsing. Cozy and welcoming.",

The book signing was for The Vermont Ghost Experience on August.18, 2023. The author of the book has been advised and has been made aware.\n\nI am all for supporting local business but this establishment owned and operated by this individual doesn't belong in our community. Buy your books elsewhere that has better customer service and candor because it certainly is not this place! Put this woman out of business so she can enjoy living with her broke mean miserable self fulltime.\n\nUpdate 8/19/2023 this bookstore owner is trying to defend the indefensible in her response, go figures, she is a sick woman. I wasn't the person that was disrespected, I saw it happen and was appalled at the treatment of another customer.",

I couldn't have asked for more in regards to the service that Ana from Bartleby's Books provided to me in regards to this, from the email communications, in taking my order over the phone and preparing my order for a courier pickup that I had arranged. Above all, I was impressed by the genuine desire to assist me, and I would like to thank Bartleby's Books and Ana' for their efforts and the fantastic customer experience that I have had. Thank you, and I very much appreciate it. I will definitely be contacting Bartleby's Books again if I am in need of a helping hand. I highly recommend Bartleby's Books.",

I was on the lookout for a book by a local author, and they steered me through a variety of genres, including history, nonfiction, fiction, mystery, and fantasy. Like any good indie bookstore, they also offer some local souvenirs and gifts, and there\u2019s also limited seating on their second floor.

They really have an excellent smattering of curious used books, engaging new titles, a whole swath of comics and graphic novels and the freshest table top games. And the staff is super knowledgeable and always friendly, \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc15 friendly too.\n\nI do wish they had more room to serve tea and let you play games, I would take friends old and new here more; typically I just graze the 'out of my budget' board games and leave empty handed. Totally worth checking out though.",

A book lover's dream!\n\nTo those of you who are saying the books are overpriced, that ain't so. I worked in a library for 3 years, where I was constantly checking for the replacement prices of books, so I developed a pretty good feel for the cost of a book. Gheesh, in many cases, it's a book I myself remember researching for my job, and I know the price off the top of my head! Altogether, these books are priced according to their value. You might get an underpriced one at a garage sale or a Goodwill, where nobody knows how to research books, but that's a gamble and you could wait for years for an accidental deal like that. If you want the book now, then these books are priced correctly and are the best you'll ever find in a bookstore, either brick-and-mortar or online!\n\nPublic library book sales can afford to be dirt cheap because they're just trying to get rid of excess books and it's either practically give them away or dump them. Also, your public library doesn't have to make money -  it is funded by your tax dollars. Book stores don't run on the same logic, so they can't afford to give away their books for a few bucks here and there. That is why library sales underprice, but actual book stores price correctly according to the going value.",
